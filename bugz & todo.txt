-revise dhcputility.bytestoint(), consider using bitset instead
-revise flags field in dhcp message, send unicast or broadcast

-When allocating a new address,
      servers SHOULD check that the offered network address is not

      already in use; e.g., the server may probe the offered address
      with an ICMP Echo Request.  Servers SHOULD be implemented so that
      network administrators MAY choose to disable probes of newly
      allocated addresses. 

- revise dhcpmessage request and discover messages templates

-revise bitset size calculation... could be wrong
 (change bitsets to left is least sig bit for calculations then output bytes as right most sig)


-change assign ip to assign using bitset functions for efficency
